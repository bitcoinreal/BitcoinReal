Yet, the past 9 years have excruciatingly shown the lack of a third missing feature, which the brought the community to take action upon vacancy, ending up with the creation of endless Bitcoin Forks "real" Bitcoins", such as BitcoinCash, BitcoinGreen, BitcoinPrivate, BitcoinDiamond. All of these coins have been created because of this third and fundamental feature is missing. Bitcoin lacks innovation. Or rather it has innovation, it simply is extremely slow and cautious., and in the cryptocurrency, innovation is moving fast, the fastest possible. And this is the need that we seek to satisfy.
